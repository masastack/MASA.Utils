## Masa.Utils.Extensions.DependencyInjection

### Reference package:

````c#
Install-Package Masa.Utils.Extensions.DependencyInjection
````
### Usage:

````C#
services.AddAutoInject();
````

## Dependent interface:

* ISingletonDependency: registers a service whose lifecycle is Singleton
* IScopedDependency: registers a service whose lifecycle is Scoped
* ITransientDependency: registers services whose lifecycle is Transient
* IAutoFireDependency: is automatically triggered (used in combination with ISingletonDependency, IScopedDependency, and ITransientDependency to trigger a service acquisition operation after the service is automatically registered, only inheriting IAutoFireDependency does not work)

Example:

````c#
public interface IRepository<TEntity> : IScopedDependency
    where TEntity : class
{

}
````

> Because IRepository<TEntity> inherits IScopedDependency, the life cycle of IRepository<TEntity> will be Scoped

## Rule:

Scan the interfaces and classes that inherit ISingletonDependency, IScopedDependency, and ITransientDependency in the assembly, and automatically register services for them

* When inheriting an interface, its ServiceType is the current interface, and its ImplementationType is the implementation class of the current interface
   * If the current interface has multiple implementation classes, it will be added multiple times

     ```` C#
     public interface IUserService : IScopedDependency
     {

     }

     public class UserService : IUserService
     {

     }
     ````
     > Equivalent to service.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();

* When the inherited class is not an interface, its ServiceType is the current class, and its ImplementationType is also the current class
   * By default, the cascade scan registration service is supported, and subclasses of the current class will also be registered

     ```` C#
     public class BaseRepository : ISingletonDependency
     {

     }

     /// <summary>
     /// Abstract classes are not automatically registered
     /// </summary>
     public abstract class CustomizeBaseRepository : ISingletonDependency
     {

     }

     public class UserRepository : BaseRepository
     {

     }
     ````

     > Equivalent to: service.AddSingleton<BaseRepository>();service.AddSingleton<UserRepository>();

## Features:

* IgnoreInjection: Ignore injection, used to exclude sub-services from being injected automatically

## Methods:

* GetInstance<T>(): Get the instance of service T
* Any<T>(): whether service T exists, does not support generic services
* Any<T>(ServiceLifetime.Singleton): Whether there is a service T whose life cycle is Singleton, does not support generic services
